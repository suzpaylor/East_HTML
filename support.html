			<!--ABOUT EAST-->
			<br />
			<h3>About our School</h3>
			<p>East High School is a rigorous and diverse public school of 2,000 students. Approximately 64% of the student body
				is living below the poverty line (including 85 homeless students). The East High Student and Family Support
				Initiative was created in 2016 to assist these students. We evaluate and fulfill the unique needs of each student,
				to assure that they have their basic needs met. This includes some dental and vision assistance. At East we feel
				that if the student is not worrying about pain, food, clothing, and cleanliness, they will be better able to thrive
				in school and in life.
				<br />
				<br />
				To that end, the Leopard Stash (food pantry) provides healthy snacks and meal making materials for students and
				their families. The Stash is open before and after school each day. The Leopard Boutique is our own "clothing
				store" where students and families find new and gently used clothing, shoes and jackets. The newly completed
				Leopard Washrooms provide a clean and safe place for our homeless and vulnerable students to wash clothing, shower
				and prepare for their school day. The Washrooms are stocked with items for the student and their family, including
				new underwear, socks, towels and every possible shower/bathroom product needed. We hope, with support from donors,
				to soon facilitate scholarship offerings, work internships and summer jobs for hardworking students that need a
				little extra help during tough times.
				<br />
				<br />
				All of these services are provided free of charge to any of our students and their families. These programs are
				supported 100% through in-kind gifts and cash, generously donated by East High students, families, PTA and an
				amazing community of individuals and companies who LOVE EAST and want to help each student succeed!.</p>
