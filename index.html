					East High School Family Support has lost a dear friend.  Virginia Stevens, our amazing monster cookie making
					angel, passed away on Friday.  Even as she battled cancer she made sure to bring her delicious homemade cookies to
					the Stash each and every week. Her son, Dave Steven's recalls, 'She loved taking cookies to the Stash! It was
					very important to her to get that last batch of cookies down to East High a few days ago.  It brought her so
					much happiness to think of her cookies bringing joy to the kids, especially those facing hardship.  One of the
					last things that she told me was that it was 'especially fun because we didn't have to do it.'  We will miss
					Virginia and her support of the students of East High.<a href="https://www.larkinmortuary.com/obituary/virginia-bird-stevens/">

							East High School is a rigorous and diverse public school of 2000 students. Approximately 64%
							of these students
							live
							below the poverty line, receiving free/reduced breakfasts and lunches. In addition, close to
							400 of our students
							are
							refugees. At most risk are the 85 to 95 students who are homeless. The East High Student and
							Family Support
							Initiative was created in 2016 to assist these students and their families.

			<p class="feature major major-text">AVID at East is currently in it's 11th year! AVID is a 4 year elective
				course,
				designed to assist first generation, lower socio-economic students as they navigate the pathway to
				college and
				career. These are highly motivated students who intend to pursue a four year college or university. East
				Hight AVID
				has a 100% graduation rate from high school and an 88% acceptance rate into college. <span
					style="font-weight: bold;">We
					are looking for volunteers, especially those who can help support students in collaborative tutorial
					study groups.
				</span>The tutors facilitate student-led discussions in a group setting, enabling students find the
				answer to a
				question, problem, project, and any other school-work related point of confusion they may have. This
				leads to
				deeper learning and engagement in their core classrooms. We are looking for tutors who can be in the
				AVID classroom
				on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wednesday
					and or Thursday</span> for all or part of the day (9:15-2:30). To learn more about AVID visit <a

				<h3>AVID stands for Advancement Via Individual Determination.</h3>
				<p></p>It is a college readiness system that prepares students in kindergarten through 12th grade for
				college
				eligibility and success. Some colleges and universities have also implemented AVID to help their
				students. Since it
				began in 1980 in California, AVID has been adopted by more than 5,600 schools, including 40 colleges and
				universities, in 44 states and 16 countries, making a difference in the lives of 1.2 million students.
				</p>
				<p>
					AVID is for all students but targets those in the academic middle and who are usually under-served.
					Its systematic
					approach is designed to support students and educators as they increase school-wide/district-wide
					learning and
					performance. AVID is not a remedial, niche or college outreach program. It is not a free ride nor is
					it a study
					hall. Students must learn and apply the skills they are taught in their AVID elective class as well
					as do the
					academically rigorous work required.</p>


				<h3>AVID's mission</h3>
				<ul>AVID’s mission is to close the achievement gap by preparing all students for college readiness and
					success in a
					global society. It is designed to ensure all students, especially the least served students who are
					in the
					academic
					middle to:
					<li>Succeed in rigorous curriculum</li>
					<li>Complete a rigorous college preparatory path</li>
					<li>Enter mainstream activities of the school</li>
					<li>Enroll in college</li>
					<li>Become educated and responsible participants and leaders in their communities and our society
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>What AVID Is</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>AVID is for middle to upper middle academic students. These students have the potential for
						Honors and AP
						(Advanced Placement) work but need to develop the skills needed to be successful in rigorous
						courses.</li>
					<li>AVID combines rigor with support that includes the student's individual determination and the
						support of
						teachers, other AVID students and their families and AVID tutors.</li>
					<li>Students must maintain 2.0 or higher GPA throughout the school year.</li>
				</ul>

				<!--ABOUT EAST-->
				<br />
				<h3>About our School</h3>
				<p>East High School is a rigorous and diverse public school of 2,000 students. Approximately 64% of the
					student
					body
					is living below the poverty line (including 85 homeless students). The East High Student and Family
					Support
					Initiative was created in 2016 to assist these students. We evaluate and fulfill the unique needs of
					each student,
					to assure that they have their basic needs met. This includes some dental and vision assistance. At
					East we feel
					that if the student is not worrying about pain, food, clothing, and cleanliness, they will be better
					able to
					thrive
					in school and in life.
					<br />
					<br />
					To that end, the Leopard Stash (food pantry) provides healthy snacks and meal making materials for
					students and
					their families. The Stash is open before and after school each day. The Leopard Boutique is our own
					"clothing
					store" where students and families find new and gently used clothing, shoes and jackets. The newly
					completed
					Leopard Washrooms provide a clean and safe place for our homeless and vulnerable students to wash
					clothing, shower
					and prepare for their school day. The Washrooms are stocked with items for the student and their
					family, including
					new underwear, socks, towels and every possible shower/bathroom product needed. We hope, with
					support from donors,
					to soon facilitate scholarship offerings, work internships and summer jobs for hardworking students
					that need a
					little extra help during tough times.
					<br />
					<br />
					All of these services are provided free of charge to any of our students and their families. These
					programs are
					supported 100% through in-kind gifts and cash, generously donated by East High students, families,
					PTA and an
					amazing community of individuals and companies who LOVE EAST and want to help each student succeed!.
